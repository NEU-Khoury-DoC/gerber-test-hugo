# Deliverable 2
## My Contributions

In this phase of the project my main contributions were API sourcing, reading, cleaning, and plotting. I also started our machine learning model to make a proof of concept. Most of the APIs I read in are not yet reflected in our plots and code but will be used later. This is because of the challenges with the cleaning/collection which I will mention later. 

I made a dataframe with information like Country, GDP, and Quarter. This will be merged with the current Flight dataframe that we worked with for this deliverable, and will be used to flesh out our linear regression model. I am also working on adding hotel prices to this and we will use those to return a predicted hotel price along with the predicted flight price for the userâ€™s trip. The hotel data has been a challenge since after many errors we realised that we have to go on tripadvisor and manually ensure that each hotel has availability on each of our dates. 

I used plotly and seaborn to plot the relationships between some of the columns in our Flight dataframe that Nalika collected and I also fit a simple linear regression model to the Date and Price columns. These will be used to explore the relationships between our data and help us choose which factors will be most useful in predicting flight and hotel prices. 

Outside of the project, I've been trying to explore Belgium more to get to know the place we are living in this month. I've found a few cute places to shop and eat that me and my friends have gone to and we've been exploring the architecture of Leuven too. Another part of the Belgium experience outside the project have been all the lectures and site visits that we've done, which have given me valuable insights on the ways we can integrate data into government and even given me some potential ideas for future co-ops.
