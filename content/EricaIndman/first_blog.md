# Beguinages
## The Women's Safe Haven of Leuven

Something interesting that I learned about on the Dialogue so far was the Beguinage of Leuven that we visited on the walking tour. In the early 13th century this Beguinage was created as an alternative for unmarried women who did not want to fully become nuns. Here, they could follow the same rules as nuns with the exception of the vow of poverty, meaning they could retain their own belongings and make money. Because of that, it was an escape for the many women who wanted to keep their autonomy in a time where it was extremely rare for a woman to have that. Throughout the centuries it housed many women and was a flourishing community. 

During the religious conflicts in the 16th century it fell on hard times but had another period of use from the end of the 16th century until it was taken over by anti-religious French revolutionaries. Beguines continued to live there but free space was used for welfare housing.

After 150 years of being used by the local welfare commission to house people without the means to get another place to stay, it was almost torn down and replaced by highrises by a developer when the KU Leuven university bought it to preserve it. Nowadays, it is used as university housing for KU Leuven students and is a tourist attraction for people interested in this cityâ€™s history. 

I found the history of this place to be beautiful and interesting because it was an escape from the patriarchal rules of past society for women and allowed them a space to be themselves, make their own money, and most importantly their own choices.
