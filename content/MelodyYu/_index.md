I am a driven second-year Computer Science and Philosophy student at Northeastern University, with a passion for teaching and a knack for collaborative project design and completion. Through my coursework, I have gained a strong technical foundation, and my experience in teaching has sharpened my communication and organizational skills. I am eager to leverage my expertise and enthusiasm to contribute to innovative projects and foster meaningful collaborations.
