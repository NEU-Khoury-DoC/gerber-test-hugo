## NATO Visit

### Perspectives on Defense and Technology

Before visiting NATO, I knew little about the organization other than that it was a defense alliance between Europe and the US/Canada. I felt somewhat uncomfortable and critical of the defense industry, influenced by discussions in my philosophy classes and the current political climate. I questioned the ethical implications of technologies that contribute to war and conflict, especially as my co-op starting in July is with a security company that serves the defense industry. From the sessions, I learned a lot about the specifics of what NATO does, and how it is defensively-minded, rather than offensive. I also really liked hearing about the ethical standards that were written for new technologies, and how diverse groups of people (philosophers, feminist theorists, political scientists, technologists etc.) came together to develop these standards. I think working on something like may be something I'm interested in the future.

### Hybrid Attacks and Online Polarization

I also thought the session on hybrid attacks and fake news was fascinating. It was especially relevant to me, as the research I do at Northeastern ties closely to online dialogue. One of the professors I work with, Soroush Vosoughi, wrote an article in 2018 about fake news that was cited over 8,000 times. I am currently working on research about intellectual humility, a virtue that seeks to decrease toxicity and polarization - something that fake news tries to sow. I learned about how a big part of the response to these hybrid attacks was the education of those vulnerable, and I think it'd be cool to work on some kind of AI-powered intervention in the future.

## My Contributions to the Group Project
Since I've worked with github and github pages before, I showed my team how to set up this site. For our project itself, we brainstormed and ...
