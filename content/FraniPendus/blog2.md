# Indivudal Blog #2
## Project Phase II Contributions


During this phase of the project, my team and I revised our initial proposal as well as continued advancing our app. On the Data Science side, the data was cleaned, and a proof of concept was created for a regression model. On the Computer Science side, the localized data models for our three user personas were created and integrated into a global data model, and the based SQL DDL (created table statements) was written.
	
Since I am a Computer Science (half) major, I was responsible for creating both the localized and global data models as well as initializing the SQL code for our app’s database. I began this process by first thinking about and listing the attributes needed for each of our three user personas as each persona is its own entity. Then, I created a list of other entities needed for each of the three user persona interactions as well as their attributes. After adding all of these entities and attributes to my Excali drawing, I created the connections (relationships) between them. Finally, I wrote in the participation and cardinality for each relationship. Once my data model was complete, I translated the drawing into code. I created a table for each entity, chose the proper data types for each attribute, and added in the restrictions and references for the attributes where necessary.
	
I think the hardest part of this phase of the project was being meticulous with all of the details on the Excali drawing like the participation and caridnality.  Despite the fact that the overall process was long and took a lot of critical thinking, it has been so gratifying to see our team’s app idea become a reality through the collection and representation of data.
