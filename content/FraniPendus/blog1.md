The most intriguing experience I have had so far in Belgium was going to the EEAS, European Union External Action Service. Located in Brussels, the EEAS has 2300 people who perform diplomatic services and coordinate compromises among nations.  

One area the EEAS has more recently been focusing on is creating digital governance through comprehensive policies that are implemented throughout the European Union. The quantity and sophistication of cyber security threats has significantly increased in the last ten years, with the top threats being DDos and ransomware and the top sector affected being public administration. 

One of EEASâ€™s role is to advance and strengthen cyberspace rules by creating policies that prevent, deter and respond to threats which will overall enhance global resilience through cyber capacity. Currently, there are three principal legislative frameworks that serve this role:
		NIS2: streamlines cyber security governance for all 27 European states
		Cyber Resilience Act: cybersecurity rules for the market of hardware and software
		Cyber Security Act: detects, prepares and responds to threats 

The EEAS also works to mitigate the effects of Disinformation and Information Manipulation (FIMI) which is defined as: a pattern of behaviour that threatens or has the potential to negatively impact values, procedures and political processes. The ecosystem that fosters FIMI includes the following:
		Actor
		Behaviour
		Content
		Degree
		Effect 
By analyzing this ecosystem, the EEAS is able to respond and illuminate the truth behind FIMI. 

I found learning about these concepts to be really interesting because it depicts how governments react to changing technologies and their associated emerging threats. By working to block and mitigate both cybersecurity threats and FIMI, I was able to learn more about the measures necessary to protect individuals and nations in a standardized manner. The visit to the EEAS emphasized the importance of international cooperation and diplomacy in addressing global challenges while still maintaining democratic values.
	
As a computer science and business major, I walked away from this visit with a better appreciation and understanding of the connection between policy-making and technology as it continues to advance at a never seen before rate.
