# Individual Blog #3
## Luxembourg

![](lux.jpeg)

This past week in the dialogue has been my favorite because we got to go to Luxembourg. Luxembourg was beautiful and it was one of my favorite cities that I’ve ever visited. We arrived Friday night,  had a group dinner at the hotel and then played hide and seek and manhunt in the backyard. All our windows all opened up to the yard, so like the kids we are, naturally we climbed through them. 

Saturday was Sonia’s birthday and a few of us went on a 5 mile hike in Schengen, which is a small town in the south of Luxembourg that borders both Germany and France. While we were waiting for everyone else who wanted to hike to arrive, we walked around by the river (Moselle) where there were swans and ducks I had never seen before. There was also a lot of history in this town as they had pieces of the Berlin wall and all the flags of the countries in the European Union. 

It was finally time to go on the hike. We walked to the base of the trail, past the vineyards in Luxembourg. The hike was absolutely beautiful. It was hilly and woodsy, but also full of plains of wheat that stretched out so far you couldn’t see the end of them. We took a break at one of these plains and went up to a really old lookout tower that was so small only three people could fit inside. We had to climb an old, rickety ladder to get up there. Even from above, you could not see the end of these French plains. 

We continued onwards as it started to rain just enough to cool you off, but not enough to make you want to go home and abandon the hike. As we were nearing the end of the hike, we walked through vineyards and saw a lookout across the river in Germany. I felt so at peace taking in nature like that as it has been a while since I’ve been out of the city. 

After the hike, we crossed the bridge from Schengen, Luxembourg to Perl, Germany. I feel proud to say that in the span of three hours, I received a welcome to France text, a welcome to Germany text, and a welcome to Luxembourg text from T-mobile. 

Sunday, I went to Lake Echternach with the intention to swim in it. However, upon arriving, I realized I really did not want to swim in that water as I could see a plethora of bugs and algae. Regardless, I got to walk around the lake and took in the views of nature once again.

Monday, we finally returned back to Leuven. Even though I was so sad to say bye to Luxembourg, I know it is a place I will definitely go back to.

## Project Contributions
In terms of the project, I created all of the tables and generated all of the fake data. I added the tables and generated data into the database section on VS Code so that I could begin write the api routes.
