# Deliverable 3 Personal Blog Post

For the third deliverable, I worked a lot on finishing data collection and cleaning. We found a new API through Kaggle for the flights and learned how to call it. Then I created separate data frames for each country that we needed information on, and then combined them together. I then combined this flight data frame with the hotel and GDP data frames to create our main data set.  I talked with my group to figure out which columns we needed to keep and what the most ideal formatting of the table was. 

The hardest part of this process was figuring out which columns we needed to combine based on and creating duplicates of some rows so that they match up with the other rows. It was also a little difficult to figure out which features make the model the most ideal without overfitting the model.

In general, one of the most interesting places we have visited this past week was the health house. I’m really interested in implementing healthcare into Data Science, and I thought it was really cool to hear about future technologies. I’m especially interested in stem cell research and was excited to see how many applications there are for this. I recently switched to not being pre-med and was happy to see how many opportunities there still are for me to combine my interest in healthcare with data science. 

In addition, I really enjoyed visiting Luxembourg this past weekend. I rented bikes with a few people, and we rode on this trail that we found for hours. It was hard to get used to the bike at first but once I did it was so fun! I would say I like Belgium a little better since there are more places to visit, but Luxembourg had a lot of beautiful places to visit, and I had a really good time!
