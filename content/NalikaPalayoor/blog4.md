## Blog post 4

During the last phase of the project, I spend a lot of time cleaning up the data collection and ML files. Since Erica and I split up the API calling, there was a lot of stuff that was out of order, as well as files where the work was mixed up. I created new files and put everything in order. I put some repetitive code into functions to make it more neat. I deleted all the broken and unnecessary code and commented it to get it ready to turn in. I also helped create the machine learning model, and once it was complete for predicting hotel prices, I changed variable names to create a second model to predict flight prices. Lastly, I looked a little at the website design and UI! 

Speaking on the dialogue as a whole, I feel like I have really come out of this experience as a different person. Of course, I have learned so much academically, but I also feel like I’ve learned a lot about myself. I feel like during my first year of college, I made friends quickly, and although I tend to branch out more than most people, I still felt like I was around the same people a lot of the time. I went into the dialogue only vaguely, knowing of a couple of people, and I am coming out of this experience with friends I know I will stay in touch with for years to come. It felt good to know that I was able to make close friends and have meaningful conversations with new people. It’s a little sad because I don’t feel like I got super close with people until there was about a week and a half left, and I wish that I had another week here with everyone! However, during the whole time here, I really feel like everyone in the dialogue are nice people, and that we all get along as a group really well! 
	
On the academic side, I feel so much more confident that I could do a job or something harder related to data science. I’ve learned to use a lot of software that I didn’t know how to use before, and even with the software I already knew, I am much more confident with it. Also, because of the intensity with which we learned information, I am more confident in my ability to learn new things in a short period of time, which I think is so valuable for the future! In addition, I liked being able to work with a team of DS and CS students combined. I thought it was really cool that we were able to create a product because we worked together! I’m taking Database Design for summer 2, and am really interested to learn more about what the CS students were working on. I have a general understanding from seeing what Frani was doing, but I’m excited to be able to understand more about it, and be able to execute it on my own!


During this past week, one of my favorite things we did was going to see the coal mine in Genk. Although it wasnt super related to the things we are studying, it was a really cool experience because I didnt know much about that beforehand. I also liked the talk about the windmills a lot. I’ve seem a bunch of windmills since being here and have always wondered about them. In general, some of my favorite places that we visited was going to the pastry shop, going to Luxenbourg, and NATO. If you were to do the dialoge again, I would say don’t take any of those out in my opinion! 

I’m going to miss being here with this group, and you both (Dr. Gerber and Dr. Fontenot!) a lot, it has truly been a once in a lifetime experience. I’ve never traveled out of the country without my family before, and this has been such a good first experience of that. I havent felt that homesick this whole time because you both made me feel so comfortable and also had so many amazing opportunities planned for us! I had high expectations going into this program, and it truly exceeded my expectations by far. Thank you so much for everything!
